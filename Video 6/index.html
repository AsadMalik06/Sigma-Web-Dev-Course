    <h1>Core Web Vitals</h1>
    <p>Core Web Vitals are a set of metrics that Google uses to measure the user experience of a website. They focus on three main aspects: loading performance, interactivity, and visual stability.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): Measures loading performance</li>
        <li>First Input Delay (FID): Measures interactivity</li>
        <li>Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): Measures visual stability</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Improving these metrics can lead to better user experience and potentially higher rankings in search results.</p>
